    "\n",
    "    Python is a programming language that combines the features of C and Java. It offers elegant style of developing programs like C. When the programmers want to go for object orientation, Python offers classes and objects like Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Coming to a bit of history, Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the year 1991 at the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science managed by the Dutch Government. Van Rossum was working on a project to develop system utilities in C where he had to interact with the Bourne shell available in UNIX. He felt the necessity of developing a language that would fill the gap between C and the shell. This has led to the creation of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Van Rossum picked the name Python for the new language from the TV show, Monty Python's Flying Circus. Python's first working version was ready by early 1990 and Van Rossum released it for the public on February 20, 1991. The logo of Python shows two intertwined snakes as shown in Figure\n",

    "    Python is open source software, which means anybody can freely download it from www.python.org and use it to develop programs. Its source code can be accessed and modified as required in the projects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    ">>><h1><font color=\"MediumVioletRed\">Features of Python</font></h1>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are various reasons why Python is gaining good popularity in the programming community. The following are some of the important features of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Simple :</font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is a simple programming language. When we read a Python program, we feel like reading English sentences. It means more clarity and less stress on understanding the syntax of the language. Hence, developing and understanding programs will become easy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Easy to learn:</font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python uses very few keywords. Its programs use very simple structure. So, developing programs in Python become easy. Also, Python resembles C language. Most of the language constructs in C are also available in Python. Hence, migrating from C to Python is easy for programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Open source: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is no need to pay for Python software. Python can be freely downloaded from www.python.org website. Its source code can be read, modified and can be used in programs as desired by the programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">High level language:  </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Programming languages are of two types: low level and high level. A low level language uses machine code instructions to develop programs.These instructions directly interact with the CPU. Machine language and assembly language are called low level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    High level languages use English words to develop programs. These are easy to learn and use. Like COBOL, PHP or Java, Python also uses English words in its programs and hence it is called high level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Dynamically typed: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, we need not declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type. If a name is assigned to an object of one type, it may later be assigned to an object of a different type. This is the meaning of the saying that Python is a dynamically typed language. Languages like C and Java are statically typed. In these languages, the variable names and datatypes should be mentioned properly. Attempting to assign an object of the wrong type to a variable name triggers error or exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Platform independent: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a Python program is compiled using a Python.compiler, it generates byte code. Python's byte code represents a fixed set of instructions that run on all operating systems and hardware. Using a Python Virtual Machine (PVM), anybody can run these byte code instructions on any computer system. Hence, Python programs are not dependent on any specific operating system. We can use Python on almost all operating systems like UNIX, Linux, Windows,Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, etc. This makes Python an ideal programming language for any network or Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Portable: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a program yields the same result on any computer in the world, then it is called a portable program. Python programs will give the same result since they are platform independent. Once a Python program is written, it can run on any computer system using PVM. However, Python also contains some system dependent modules (or code), which are specific to operating system. Programmers should be careful about such code while developing the software if they want it to be completely. portable.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Procedure and object oriented: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python is a procedure oriented as well as an object oriented programming language. In procedure oriented programming languages (e.g. C and Pascal), the programs are built using functions and procedures. But in object oriented languages (e.g. C++ and Java), the programs use classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Interpreted: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    A program code is called source code. After writing a Python program, we should compile the source code using Python compiler. Python compiler translates the Python program into an intermediate code called byte code. This byte code is then executed by PVM. Inside the PVM, an interpreter converts the byte code instructions into machine code so that the processor will understand and run that machine code to produce results.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Extensible: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    The programs or pieces of code written in C or C++ can be integrated into Python and executed using PVM. This is what we see in standard Python that is downloaded from www.python.org. There are other flavors of Python where programs from other languages can be integrated into Python. For example, Jython is useful to integrate Java code into Python programs and run on JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Similarly, Iron Python is useful to integrate .NET programs and libraries into Python programs and run on CLR (Common Language Runtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Embeddable: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can insert Python programs into a C or C++ program. Several applications are already developed in Python which can be integrated into other programming languages like C, C++, Delphi, PHP, Java and .NET. It means programmers can use these applications for their advantage in various software projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Huge library: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python has a big library which can be used on any operating system like UNIX, Windows or Macintosh. Programmers can develop programs very easily using the modules available in the Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Scripting language: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    A scripting language is a programming language that does not use a compiler for executing the source code. Rather, it uses an interpreter to translate the source code into machine code on the fly (while running). Generally, scripting languages perform supporting tasks for a bigger application or software. For example, PHP is a scripting language that performs supporting task of taking input from an HTML page and send it to Web server software. Python is considered as a scripting language as it is interpreted and it is used on the Internet to support other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Database connectivity: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    A database represents software that stores and manipulates data. For example, Oracle is a popular database using which we can store data in the form of tables and manipulate the data. Python provides interfaces to connect its programs to all major databases like Oracle, Sybase or MySql.\n",
    "\n",
    "><h2><font color=\"DarkMagenta\">Scalable: </font></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    A program would be scalable if it could be moved to another operating system or hardware and take full advantage of the new environment in terms of performance. Python programs are scalable since they can run on any platform and use the features of the new platform effectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    ">>><h1><font color=\"MediumVioletRed\">Execution of a Python Program</font></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's assume that we write a Python program with the name x.py. Here, x is the program name and the py is the extension name. Every Python program is typed with an extension name py. After typing the program, the next step is to compile the program using Python compiler. The compiler converts the Python program into another code called byte code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Byte code represents a fixed set of instructions that represents all operations like arithmetic operations, comparison operations, memory related operations, etc., which run on any operating system and hardware. It means the byte instructions are system independent or platform independent. The size Teach byte code instruction is 1 byte and hence they are called with the name byte code. These byte code instructions are contained in the file x.pye. Here, the x.pyc file represents a python compiled file. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The next step is to run the program. If we directly give the byte code to the computer, it cannot execute them. Any computer can execute only binary code which comprises 1s and Os. Since the binary code is understandable to the machine (computer), it is also called machine code. It is therefore necessary to convert the byte code into machine code so that our computer can understand and execute it. For this purpose, we should use PVM (Python Virtual Machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "    PVM uses an interpreter which understands the byte code and converts it into machine code. PVM first understands the processor and operating system in our computer. Then it converts the byte code into machine code understandable to that processor and into that format understandable to that operating system. These machine code instructions) are then executed by the processor and results are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An interpreter translates the program source code line by line. Hence, it is slow. The interpreter that is found inside the PVM runs the Python program slowly. To rectify this problem, in some flavors of Python, a compiler is added to the PVM. This compiler also converts the byte code into machine code but faster than the interpreter. This compiler is called JIT (Just In Time) compiler. The advantage of JIT compiler is to improve speed of execution of a Python program and thus improving the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We should remember that JIT compiler is not available in all Python environments. For example, the standard Python software is called CPython which is created using C language that does not include a JIT compiler. But, PyPy, which is created in Python language itself uses a JIT compiler in addition to an interpreter in the PVM. So, the PyPy flavor of Python definitely offers faster execution of the Python programs than CPython. Figure 2 shows the steps for executing a Python program:\n",
    "#### Figure2 :  Steps of Execution of a Python Program\n",
    "![](python2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>><h1><font color=\"MediumVioletRed\">Python Virtual Machine (PVM)</font></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "    We know that computers understand only machine code that comprises 1s and Os. Since computer understands only machine code, it is imperative that we should convert any program into machine code before it is submitted to the computer for execution. For this purpose, we should take the help of a compiler. A compiler normally converts the program source code into machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Python compiler does the same task but in a slightly different manner. It converts the program source code into another code, called byte code. Each Python program statement is converted into a group of byte code instructions. Then what is byte code? Byte code represents the fixed set of instructions created by Python developers representing all types of operations. The size of each byte code instruction is 1 byte (or 8 bits) and hence these are called byte code instructions. Python organization says that there may be newer instructions added to the existing byte code instructions from time to time. We can find byte code instructions in the .pyc file. Figure 3 shows the role of virtual machine in converting byte code instructions into machine code:\n",
    "#### Figure 3 : The Python Virtual Machine\n",
    "![](python3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The role of Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is to convert the byte code instructions into machine code so that the computer can execute those machine code instructions and display the final output. To carry out this conversion, PVM is equipped with an interpreter. The interpreter converts the byte code into machine code and sends that machine code to the computer processor for execution. Since interpreter is playing the main role, often the Python Virtual Machine is also called an interpreter.\n",
    "    \n",
    ">>><h1><font color=\"MediumVioletRed\">Memory Management in Python</font></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "    In C or C++, the programmer should allocate and deallocate (or free) memory dynamically, during runtime. For example, to allocate memory, the programmer may use malloc() function and to deallocate the memory, he may use the free() function. But in Python, memory allocation and deallocation are done during runtime automatically. The programmer need not allocate memory while creating objects or deallocate memory when deleting the objects. Python's PVM will take care of such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Everything is considered as an object in Python. For example, strings are objects. Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Even modules are also objects. For every object, memory should be allocated. Memory manager inside the PVM allocates memory required for objects created in a Python program. All these objects are stored on a separate memory called heap. Heap is the memory which is allocated during runtime. The size of the heap memory depends on the Random Access Memory (RAM) of our computer and it can increase or decrease its size depending on the requirement of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "    We know that the actual memory (RAM) for any program is allocated by the underlying Operating system. On the top of the Operating system, a raw memory allocator oversees whether enough memory is available to it for storing objects. On the top of the raw allocator, there are several object-specific allocators operate on the same heap. These memory allocators will implement different types of memory management policies depending on the type of the objects. For example, an integer number should be stored in memory in one way and a string should be stored in a different way. Similarly, when we deal with tuples and dictionaries, they should be stored differently. These issues are taken care of by object-specific memory allocators. Figure 1.5 shows the allocation of memory by Python's Virtual Machine:\n",
